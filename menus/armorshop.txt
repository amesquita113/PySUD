Dwarven Armor Shop
	The shop is dimly light, most of the light coming in from the flames
of the forges.  Sounds of hammers striking anvils fill the room, and the smell
of dwarven ale and sweat is thick in the air.  A surly dwarf stands behind a 
small counter, fine suits of armor line the shop behind him.
