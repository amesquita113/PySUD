In PySUD there is 2 classes you can choose from:

1 - Fighter:	A fighter is a melee warrior, they fight up close and
		personal. They are hearty and strong, with high survivability
		at the cost of taking a bit longer to kill their enemies. 
		High health, strength and constitution are important to a
		fighter. Strenght will make their attacks hit harder, while
		high constitution will raise their health.

2 - Sorcerer:  	A Sorcerer is a deadly adversary, avoiding direct combat in
		favour of nuking their enemies from afar.  What they lack in
		survivability they make up for with the strength of their
		deadly magic.  Wisdom is the stat of choice for highly 
		offensive Sorcerers, while one needing a bit more survival
		may want to put extra points into Dexterity or Charisma.
