Town Square
	The town square is alive with activity.  A bard sits in the center of
the square playing the lute and singing of great heros.  Townsfolk are 
drinking and mingling, it appears there must be some sort of festival going 
on.  Main St. runs north and south through the square and Center St. runs east
and west.
