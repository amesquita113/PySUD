Catacombs Entrance
	You are at the entrance to the catacombs, Looking down into the
darkness you can't guess what lies ahead for you inside the dark depths.  You
know whatever lies within isn't for the feint of heart.  Many battle hardened
warriors have entered never to be heard from again.  East leads into the
catacombs, and Center St. is to the west.
